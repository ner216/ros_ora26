# IMU Sensor Integration with ROS

 The purpose of this program is to capture and publish IMU data using a MicroROS agent. This will publish acceleration, gyroscopic, and quaternion data to the corresponding ROS topic.

## Hardware
* [ESP32 WROOM-DA](https://www.microcenter.com/product/704603/ESP-32_Development_Board_-_3_Pack?storeID=055)
* [BNO086](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-vr-imu-breakout-bno086-qwiic.html)

## Software setup

### Micro ROS agent
First, go to the scripts directory in the repository.
``` 
cd ../ESP32_IMU_Micro_ROS/scripts
```

Then to build the micro ROS agent, run the following shell script:
``` 
cd ./setup_microros_ws.sh
```

When the building process has finished, the host computer is setup to run the micro ROS agent.

### Installing proper ESP32 libraries
There are two libraries that need to be installed. One for the BNO086 and the other for the micro-ROS implementation on the ESP32.

#### BNO086 Library
In the Arduino IDE library manager, search for `SparkFun BNO08x Cortex Based IMU`. It should show the following:
![BNO_Lib_Image](./Documentation/BNO086_ESP_Library.png)


#### micro-ROS Library
In the Arduino IDE library manager, search for `micro_ros_arduino`. It should show the following:

![Library_Image](./Documentation/micro_ros_arduino_library.png)
<br><br>

---

### Using proper ESP32 board library version

There is a bug in the micro ROS arduino library that limits the refresh rate the agent updates the topic. In order to fix this, the ESP32 board library version needs to be downgraded to `2.0.17`

<br><br>



## Executing program
Upload the follwoing program to the ESP32 in the Arduino IDE.
``` 
ESP32_Micro_ROS.ino
```

Then, execute the `run_microros.sh` script.

The ESP will continue to retry the connection while the agent is inactive.

*If the agent doesn't connect, reset the ESP32*

### Viewing IMU Data on ROS Topic
To view the data that is being published to the ROS topic, execute the following command
```
ros2 topic echo /imu --no-arr
```
IMU data should be updating in the echo terminal window.<br><br>

### Sending Service Calls with Boolean to ROS Node
In order to control the Autonomous LED pin, a service message needs to be sent. Depending on the data packed in the message the LED will either turn on or off.

**LED On**
```
ros2 service call /set_autonomous_led_state std_srvs/srv/SetBool "{data: true}"
```

**LED Off**
```
ros2 service call /set_autonomous_led_state std_srvs/srv/SetBool "{data: false}"
```

A response message should be sent back and show in the terminal verifying the LED is in the set state.
